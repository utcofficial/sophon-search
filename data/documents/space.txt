The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, such as the five dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.

The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen; the rest is mostly helium, with much smaller quantities of heavier elements.

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.

The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth, it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term. It has no significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's.

The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The ISS serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific experiments are conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields.

Black holes are regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed.

The Hubble Space Telescope is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy. The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.

Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds of lunar material to bring back to Earth.

The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos, "milky circle"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within the galaxy. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.

Exoplanets are planets outside the Solar System. The first possible evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917, but was not recognized as such. The first confirmation of detection occurred in 1992. A different planet, initially detected in 1988, was confirmed in 2003. As of 1 January 2022, there are 4,905 confirmed exoplanets in 3,630 planetary systems, with 806 systems having more than one planet. The Kepler space telescope has also detected a few thousand candidate planets, of which about 11% may be false positives.

The Earth has seven continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Asia is the largest and most populous continent, covering about 30% of Earth's land area and containing about 60% of the world's population. It includes countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia. Africa is the second-largest continent, with 54 countries and a rich diversity of cultures, languages, and ecosystems. It includes the Sahara Desert, the Nile River, and the Serengeti. North America includes Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the countries of Central America and the Caribbean. South America includes the Amazon rainforest, the Andes mountains, and countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Peru. Antarctica is the southernmost continent, covered by ice and with no permanent human population. Europe is a continent of peninsulas and islands, with a rich cultural heritage and countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Australia (also called Oceania) includes Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and the Pacific islands.

The world's oceans include the Pacific Ocean (the largest and deepest), the Atlantic Ocean (second largest), the Indian Ocean (third largest), the Southern Ocean (surrounding Antarctica), and the Arctic Ocean (the smallest and shallowest). The oceans cover about 71% of Earth's surface and contain 97% of Earth's water. They play a crucial role in regulating climate, absorbing carbon dioxide, and supporting marine life. Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, which brings warm water from the Gulf of Mexico to Western Europe, and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which affects weather patterns globally.

The world's longest rivers include the Nile (6,650 km) in Africa, the Amazon (6,400 km) in South America, the Yangtze (6,300 km) in China, the Mississippi-Missouri (6,275 km) in North America, and the Yenisei (5,539 km) in Russia.

The world's population is approximately 8 billion people, distributed unevenly across the globe. The most populous countries are India (1.4 billion), China (1.4 billion), the United States (335 million), Indonesia (280 million), and Pakistan (240 million). The most populous cities include Tokyo (37 million), Delhi (32 million), Shanghai (28 million), Dhaka (23 million), and São Paulo (22 million). The world's population is growing, but the rate of growth has slowed. Major demographic trends include aging populations in developed countries, urbanization (more than half the world's population now lives in cities), and international migration.

Languages are a system of communication used by humans, with estimates of 6,000-7,000 languages spoken in the world today. The most spoken languages by number of native speakers include Mandarin Chinese (920 million), Spanish (475 million), English (380 million), Hindi (345 million), and Arabic (310 million). By total speakers (including second-language speakers), English (1.4 billion), Mandarin Chinese (1.1 billion), Hindi (600 million), Spanish (550 million), and French (500 million) are the most spoken. Language families include Indo-European (English, Spanish, Hindi, Russian, German, French), Sino-Tibetan (Mandarin, Cantonese, Burmese), Niger-Congo (Swahili, Yoruba, Zulu), Afroasiatic (Arabic, Hebrew, Hausa), and Austronesian (Malay, Tagalog, Hawaiian).

Writing systems are used to record languages. Major writing systems include the Latin alphabet (used for English, Spanish, French, German), the Cyrillic alphabet (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian), the Arabic script (Arabic, Persian, Urdu), the Devanagari script (Hindi, Sanskrit, Nepali), the Chinese characters (Hanzi, used for Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese Kanji), and the Greek alphabet. The invention of writing around 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia (cuneiform) and Egypt (hieroglyphs) marked the beginning of recorded history.

The world's major religions, as mentioned, include Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism. Christianity is the largest religion, with about 2.4 billion adherents, divided into three main branches: Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy. Islam has about 1.9 billion adherents, divided into Sunni (85-90%) and Shia (10-15%) branches. Hinduism, with about 1.2 billion adherents, is the world's third-largest religion, concentrated primarily in India and Nepal. Buddhism, with about 520 million adherents, is practiced mainly in East and Southeast Asia. Judaism, with about 15 million adherents, is concentrated in Israel and the United States. Other religions include Sikhism (25 million), Shinto (104 million), Taoism (12 million), Jainism (4.5 million), and Zoroastrianism (150,000). Many people also practice folk religions or are non-religious.

Government systems vary around the world. Democracies are systems where power is vested in the people, who rule either directly or through elected representatives. Examples include the United States (presidential republic), India (parliamentary republic), and the United Kingdom (constitutional monarchy). Authoritarian systems concentrate power in the hands of a single leader or small group, with limited political freedoms. Examples include China (one-party state), North Korea (dictatorship), and Saudi Arabia (absolute monarchy). Hybrid regimes combine elements of democracy and authoritarianism. International organizations include the United Nations (193 member states), the European Union (27 member states), the African Union (55 member states), and NATO (30 member states).

Economies are systems of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The world's largest economies by nominal GDP are the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. By purchasing power parity (PPP), the largest economies are China, the United States, India, Japan, and Germany. Major economic sectors include agriculture (farming, fishing, forestry), industry (manufacturing, mining, construction), and services (finance, healthcare, education, retail). The global economy is increasingly interconnected through trade, investment, and technology. International trade is governed by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Major trade blocs include the European Union, USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

Currency is a system of money used in a particular country. Major world currencies include the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Chinese Yuan (CNY), Swiss Franc (CHF), Australian Dollar (AUD), and Canadian Dollar (CAD). The value of currencies fluctuates based on supply and demand, interest rates, inflation, and economic conditions. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are digital or virtual currencies secured by cryptography, operating independently of central banks.

The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1945 after World War II to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations. It has 193 member states. The UN's main organs include the General Assembly (all member states), the Security Council (15 members, with five permanent members: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat (headed by the Secretary-General). The UN also includes specialized agencies such as WHO (World Health Organization), UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), and the World Bank.

The Olympic Games are a major international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports, held every four years. The ancient Olympic Games began in Olympia, Greece, in 776 BCE and continued until 393 CE. The modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 in Athens, Greece. The Olympic symbol consists of five interlocking rings representing the five inhabited continents. The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (Faster, Higher, Stronger). The Summer Olympics include sports such as athletics, swimming, gymnastics, basketball, and football. The Winter Olympics include skiing, ice skating, ice hockey, and bobsledding. The Paralympic Games, for athletes with disabilities, are held immediately after the Olympics.

The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious association football (soccer) tournament in the world, held every four years. The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Uruguay. Brazil has won the most World Cups (5), followed by Germany and Italy (4 each), Argentina and France (3 each), and Uruguay (2). The tournament is one of the most-watched sporting events globally, with billions of viewers. The FIFA Women's World Cup was first held in 1991, with the United States winning the most titles (4).

The Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances. The prizes were established by the will of Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite, in 1895. Prizes are awarded in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly called the Nobel Prize in Economics) was established in 1968. Notable laureates include Marie Curie (Physics and Chemistry), Albert Einstein (Physics), Martin Luther King Jr. (Peace), and Malala Yousafzai (Peace).

Time zones are regions that observe a uniform standard time for legal, commercial, and social purposes. They are based on the rotation of the Earth, with 24 time zones around the world, each roughly 15 degrees of longitude wide. The prime meridian (0 degrees longitude) passes through Greenwich, England, and is the reference for Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. The International Date Line, roughly following the 180th meridian, is where the date changes by one day when crossed.

Calendars are systems of organizing days for social, religious, commercial, or administrative purposes. The Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, is the most widely used civil calendar today. It is a solar calendar based on the Earth's revolution around the Sun, with 365 days in a common year and 366 days in a leap year. Other calendars include the Islamic calendar (lunar), the Hebrew calendar (lunisolar), the Hindu calendar (lunisolar), and the Chinese calendar (lunisolar).

Holidays and festivals are celebrated around the world, reflecting cultural, religious, and national traditions. Major holidays include Christmas (Christian), Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha
