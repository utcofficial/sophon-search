Search engines are information retrieval systems designed to help find information stored on computer systems. The most well-known search engine is Google, which uses sophisticated algorithms to index and rank web pages. At the core of every search engine lies the inverted index, a data structure that maps content to its location within documents. When a user enters a query, the search engine looks up the terms in the inverted index, retrieves matching documents, and ranks them by relevance using algorithms like BM25 or TF-IDF. Modern search engines also incorporate machine learning to improve result quality and personalize user experiences.
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract insights from structured and unstructured data. The data science lifecycle begins with data collection from various sources including databases, APIs, web scraping, and sensors. Data cleaning and preprocessing consume the majority of a data scientist's time, involving handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and detecting outliers. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) uses statistical techniques and visualizations to understand data patterns, relationships, and distributions. Feature engineering creates meaningful input variables that improve machine learning model performance. Statistical analysis provides the foundation for drawing reliable conclusions from data through hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn help communicate findings effectively to stakeholders. Big data technologies including Hadoop, Spark, and cloud platforms enable processing of massive datasets that traditional tools cannot handle. A/B testing helps businesses make data-driven decisions by comparing different versions of products or features. Data storytelling combines analytical findings with narrative techniques to make insights accessible and actionable for non-technical audiences. Ethics in data science involves considerations of privacy, bias in algorithms, transparency, and responsible use of data. The field continues to evolve with advances in artificial intelligence and increasing data availability across all sectors of the economy.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without explicit programming. The core principle involves training algorithms on data to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for classification and regression tasks. Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data through clustering and association. Reinforcement learning teaches agents to make sequential decisions by rewarding desired behaviors. Deep learning, a specialized branch of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) revolutionized computer vision by achieving human-level performance in image recognition. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks excel at processing sequential data like time series and natural language. Transformers, introduced in 2017, have become the dominant architecture for natural language processing tasks through models like BERT and GPT. The success of machine learning depends heavily on data quality and quantity, feature engineering, and appropriate algorithm selection. Applications range from recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms to autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and language translation services.

Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, and a genre of Ancient Greek folklore. These stories concern the origin and nature of the world, the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological creatures, and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' own cult and ritual practices. Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece and on the origins of myth-making. The main Greek gods, known as the Twelve Olympians, include Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes, and Hestia or Dionysus.

Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythology and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin. Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares, Eileithyia, Hebe, and Hephaestus.

Norse mythology is the body of myths of the North Germanic peoples, stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia, and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. The source texts mention numerous gods, such as the thunder-god Thor, the raven-flanked god Odin, the goddess Freyja, and the god Loki.

Odin is a widely revered god in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, from which stems most of the information about the god, Odin is associated with wisdom, healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, war, battle, victory, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and is the husband of the goddess Frigg. In wider Germanic mythology and paganism, the god was also known in Old English as Wōden, in Old Saxon as Wōdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Wōðanaz, meaning 'lord of frenzy', or 'leader of the possessed'.

Hindu mythology is a large body of traditional narratives related to Hinduism, notably as contained in Sanskrit literature, such as the Sanskrit epics and the Puranas. As such, it is a subset of broader Indian culture. Among these, the two major epics are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The Ramayana tells the story of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon king Ravana. The Mahabharata tells the story of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes. It contains the Bhagavad Gita, a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna.

Vishnu is one of the principal deities of Hinduism, and the Supreme Being in its Vaishnavism tradition. Vishnu is the "preserver" in the Hindu triad (Trimurti) that includes Brahma and Shiva. In Vaishnavism, Vishnu is the supreme being who creates, protects, and transforms the universe. In the Shaktism tradition, the Goddess, or Devi, is described as one of the supreme, yet Vishnu is also revered. He is also known as Narayana and Hari. He is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.

Egyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient Egypt, which describe the actions of the Egyptian gods as a means of understanding the world. The beliefs that these myths express are an important part of ancient Egyptian religion. Myths appear frequently in Egyptian writings and art, particularly in short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. The principal Egyptian creation myths include the Heliopolitan creation myth, which centered on the city of Heliopolis and the sun god Ra or Atum, and the Memphite creation myth, which centered on the god Ptah.

Ra was the ancient Egyptian deity of the sun. By the Fifth Dynasty, in the 25th and 24th centuries BC, he had become one of the most important gods in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun. The cult of Ra was centred in Heliopolis. Ra was believed to rule in all parts of the created world: the sky, the earth, and the underworld. He was the god of the sun, order, kings, and the sky. Ra was portrayed as a falcon and shared characteristics with the sky god Horus.

Chinese mythology is mythology that has been passed down in oral form or recorded in literature in the geographic area now known as "China". Chinese mythology includes many varied myths from regional and cultural traditions. Chinese mythology is far from monolithic, not being an integrated system, even among Han Chinese people. Much of the mythology involves exciting stories full of fantastic people and beings, the use of magical powers, and often takes place in a mythological time or place. Chinese mythology includes creation myths, myths concerning the founding of Chinese culture and the Chinese state, and myths about the flood.

Thor is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. In Norse mythology, he is a hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the protection of humankind, and also hallowing and fertility. Besides Old Norse Þórr, the deity occurs in Old English as Þunor, in Old Frisian as Thuner, in Old Saxon as Thunar, and in Old High German as Donar, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Þun(a)raz, meaning 'Thunder'. Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples.

Anubis is the Greek name of the god of death, mummification, embalming, the afterlife, cemeteries, tombs, and the Underworld, in ancient Egyptian religion, usually depicted as a canine or a man with a canine head. Like many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts. Depicted as a protector of graves as early as the First Dynasty (c. 3100 – c. 2890 BC), he was also an embalmer. By the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055 – 1650 BC) he was replaced by Osiris in his role as lord of the underworld.

The invention of writing around 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia (cuneiform) and Egypt (hieroglyphs) marked the beginning of recorded history.

The world's major religions, as mentioned, include Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism. Christianity is the largest religion, with about 2.4 billion adherents, divided into three main branches: Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy. Islam has about 1.9 billion adherents, divided into Sunni (85-90%) and Shia (10-15%) branches. Hinduism, with about 1.2 billion adherents, is the world's third-largest religion, concentrated primarily in India and Nepal. Buddhism, with about 520 million adherents, is practiced mainly in East and Southeast Asia. Judaism, with about 15 million adherents, is concentrated in Israel and the United States. Other religions include Sikhism (25 million), Shinto (104 million), Taoism (12 million), Jainism (4.5 million), and Zoroastrianism (150,000). Many people also practice folk religions or are non-religious.

Government systems vary around the world. Democracies are systems where power is vested in the people, who rule either directly or through elected representatives. Examples include the United States (presidential republic), India (parliamentary republic), and the United Kingdom (constitutional monarchy). Authoritarian systems concentrate power in the hands of a single leader or small group, with limited political freedoms. Examples include China (one-party state), North Korea (dictatorship), and Saudi Arabia (absolute monarchy). Hybrid regimes combine elements of democracy and authoritarianism. International organizations include the United Nations (193 member states), the European Union (27 member states), the African Union (55 member states), and NATO (30 member states).

Economies are systems of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The world's largest economies by nominal GDP are the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. By purchasing power parity (PPP), the largest economies are China, the United States, India, Japan, and Germany. Major economic sectors include agriculture (farming, fishing, forestry), industry (manufacturing, mining, construction), and services (finance, healthcare, education, retail). The global economy is increasingly interconnected through trade, investment, and technology. International trade is governed by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Major trade blocs include the European Union, USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

Currency is a system of money used in a particular country. Major world currencies include the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Chinese Yuan (CNY), Swiss Franc (CHF), Australian Dollar (AUD), and Canadian Dollar (CAD). The value of currencies fluctuates based on supply and demand, interest rates, inflation, and economic conditions. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are digital or virtual currencies secured by cryptography, operating independently of central banks.

The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1945 after World War II to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations. It has 193 member states. The UN's main organs include the General Assembly (all member states), the Security Council (15 members, with five permanent members: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat (headed by the Secretary-General). The UN also includes specialized agencies such as WHO (World Health Organization), UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), and the World Bank.

The Olympic Games are a major international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports, held every four years. The ancient Olympic Games began in Olympia, Greece, in 776 BCE and continued until 393 CE. The modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 in Athens, Greece. The Olympic symbol consists of five interlocking rings representing the five inhabited continents. The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (Faster, Higher, Stronger). The Summer Olympics include sports such as athletics, swimming, gymnastics, basketball, and football. The Winter Olympics include skiing, ice skating, ice hockey, and bobsledding. The Paralympic Games, for athletes with disabilities, are held immediately after the Olympics.

The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious association football (soccer) tournament in the world, held every four years. The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Uruguay. Brazil has won the most World Cups (5), followed by Germany and Italy (4 each), Argentina and France (3 each), and Uruguay (2). The tournament is one of the most-watched sporting events globally, with billions of viewers. The FIFA Women's World Cup was first held in 1991, with the United States winning the most titles (4).

The Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances. The prizes were established by the will of Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite, in 1895. Prizes are awarded in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly called the Nobel Prize in Economics) was established in 1968. Notable laureates include Marie Curie (Physics and Chemistry), Albert Einstein (Physics), Martin Luther King Jr. (Peace), and Malala Yousafzai (Peace).

Time zones are regions that observe a uniform standard time for legal, commercial, and social purposes. They are based on the rotation of the Earth, with 24 time zones around the world, each roughly 15 degrees of longitude wide. The prime meridian (0 degrees longitude) passes through Greenwich, England, and is the reference for Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. The International Date Line, roughly following the 180th meridian, is where the date changes by one day when crossed.

Calendars are systems of organizing days for social, religious, commercial, or administrative purposes. The Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, is the most widely used civil calendar today. It is a solar calendar based on the Earth's revolution around the Sun, with 365 days in a common year and 366 days in a leap year. Other calendars include the Islamic calendar (lunar), the Hebrew calendar (lunisolar), the Hindu calendar (lunisolar), and the Chinese calendar (lunisolar).

Holidays and festivals are celebrated around the world, reflecting cultural, religious, and national traditions. Major holidays include Christmas (Christian), Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha
