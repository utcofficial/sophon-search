The French Revolution was a period of radical political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the formation of the French Consulate in November 1799. Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy, while the values and institutions it created remain central to French political discourse. The Revolution led to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, the establishment of the First French Republic, and the eventual execution of King Louis XVI.

World War I, also known as the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. It involved many of the great powers of the world, assembled into two opposing alliances: the Allies and the Central Powers. More than 70 million military personnel were mobilized, making it one of the largest wars in history. The war resulted in an estimated 9 million combatant deaths and 13 million civilian deaths, partly due to genocide and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million people mobilized from over 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. It resulted in an estimated 70–85 million fatalities, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.

The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865 between the Union and the Confederacy, the latter formed by states that seceded. The central cause of the war was the status of slavery, especially the expansion of slavery into territories acquired as a result of the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican–American War. After four years of bloody combat, the Union won, and slavery was abolished nationwide.

The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, that occurred during the period from around 1760 to about 1820–1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Output greatly increased, and a result was an unprecedented rise in population and in the rate of population growth.

The Renaissance was a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries. It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change. In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a "long Renaissance" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century. The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages.

The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc, which began following World War II. The term "cold" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945.

The Age of Discovery, also known as the Age of Exploration, was a period in European history from the 15th to the 17th century, during which Europeans engaged in extensive overseas exploration and colonization, driven by desire for new trade routes, wealth, and knowledge. The major discoveries included the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1492, the sea route to India by Vasco da Gama in 1498, and the circumnavigation of the globe by Ferdinand Magellan's expedition in 1522.

The Roman Empire was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome, consisting of large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, North Africa, and West Asia, ruled by emperors. It was founded in 27 BC when Octavian became Augustus, the first Roman emperor. The empire experienced a period of unprecedented power and prosperity known as the Pax Romana, during which it reached its greatest extent under Trajan in 117 AD. The western part collapsed in 476 AD due to internal instability and barbarian invasions, while the eastern part, known as the Byzantine Empire, survived until 1453.

The Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous land empire in history, founded by Genghis Khan in 1206. It stretched from Eastern Europe to the Sea of Japan, covering large parts of Siberia, Central Asia, China, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. At its peak, the empire covered 9.27 million square miles and ruled over 100 million people. The Mongol Empire facilitated trade and communication across Eurasia through the Pax Mongolica, but also caused widespread destruction and death.

The Earth has seven continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.

Government systems vary around the world. Democracies are systems where power is vested in the people, who rule either directly or through elected representatives. Examples include the United States (presidential republic), India (parliamentary republic), and the United Kingdom (constitutional monarchy). Authoritarian systems concentrate power in the hands of a single leader or small group, with limited political freedoms. Examples include China (one-party state), North Korea (dictatorship), and Saudi Arabia (absolute monarchy). Hybrid regimes combine elements of democracy and authoritarianism. International organizations include the United Nations (193 member states), the European Union (27 member states), the African Union (55 member states), and NATO (30 member states).

Economies are systems of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The world's largest economies by nominal GDP are the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. By purchasing power parity (PPP), the largest economies are China, the United States, India, Japan, and Germany. Major economic sectors include agriculture (farming, fishing, forestry), industry (manufacturing, mining, construction), and services (finance, healthcare, education, retail). The global economy is increasingly interconnected through trade, investment, and technology. International trade is governed by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Major trade blocs include the European Union, USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

Currency is a system of money used in a particular country. Major world currencies include the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Chinese Yuan (CNY), Swiss Franc (CHF), Australian Dollar (AUD), and Canadian Dollar (CAD). The value of currencies fluctuates based on supply and demand, interest rates, inflation, and economic conditions. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are digital or virtual currencies secured by cryptography, operating independently of central banks.

The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1945 after World War II to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations. It has 193 member states. The UN's main organs include the General Assembly (all member states), the Security Council (15 members, with five permanent members: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat (headed by the Secretary-General). The UN also includes specialized agencies such as WHO (World Health Organization), UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), and the World Bank.

The Olympic Games are a major international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports, held every four years. The ancient Olympic Games began in Olympia, Greece, in 776 BCE and continued until 393 CE. The modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 in Athens, Greece. The Olympic symbol consists of five interlocking rings representing the five inhabited continents. The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (Faster, Higher, Stronger). The Summer Olympics include sports such as athletics, swimming, gymnastics, basketball, and football. The Winter Olympics include skiing, ice skating, ice hockey, and bobsledding. The Paralympic Games, for athletes with disabilities, are held immediately after the Olympics.

The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious association football (soccer) tournament in the world, held every four years. The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Uruguay. Brazil has won the most World Cups (5), followed by Germany and Italy (4 each), Argentina and France (3 each), and Uruguay (2). The tournament is one of the most-watched sporting events globally, with billions of viewers. The FIFA Women's World Cup was first held in 1991, with the United States winning the most titles (4).

The Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances. The prizes were established by the will of Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite, in 1895. Prizes are awarded in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly called the Nobel Prize in Economics) was established in 1968. Notable laureates include Marie Curie (Physics and Chemistry), Albert Einstein (Physics), Martin Luther King Jr. (Peace), and Malala Yousafzai (Peace).

Time zones are regions that observe a uniform standard time for legal, commercial, and social purposes. They are based on the rotation of the Earth, with 24 time zones around the world, each roughly 15 degrees of longitude wide. The prime meridian (0 degrees longitude) passes through Greenwich, England, and is the reference for Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. The International Date Line, roughly following the 180th meridian, is where the date changes by one day when crossed.

Calendars are systems of organizing days for social, religious, commercial, or administrative purposes. The Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, is the most widely used civil calendar today. It is a solar calendar based on the Earth's revolution around the Sun, with 365 days in a common year and 366 days in a leap year. Other calendars include the Islamic calendar (lunar), the Hebrew calendar (lunisolar), the Hindu calendar (lunisolar), and the Chinese calendar (lunisolar).

Holidays and festivals are celebrated around the world, reflecting cultural, religious, and national traditions. Major holidays include Christmas (Christian), Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha (Islamic), Diwali (Hindu), Hanukkah (Jewish), Lunar New Year (Chinese and other East Asian cultures), Thanksgiving (United States and Canada), Independence Day (various countries), and New Year's Day (global). Festivals celebrate music (Coachella, Glastonbury), film (Cannes, Sundance), and culture (Carnival in Rio de Janeiro and Venice).

Cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques, and dishes, often associated with a specific culture or region. Major cuisines include Italian (pasta, pizza, risotto), French (sauces, pastries, cheese), Chinese (dim sum, stir-fry, noodles), Japanese (sushi, ramen, tempura), Indian (curry, tandoori, biryani), Mexican (tacos, enchiladas, mole), Thai (curries, pad thai, tom yum), Spanish (paella, tapas), Greek (moussaka, souvlaki), Middle Eastern (hummus, falafel, kebabs), and American (hamburgers, barbecue, apple pie). Food is not only sustenance but also an expression of cultural identity and creativity.

Etiquette refers to the customary code of polite behavior in society or among members of a particular profession or group. It varies across cultures. In many Western cultures, etiquette includes shaking hands when greeting, maintaining eye contact, saying "please" and "thank you," and not interrupting others. In Japanese culture, bowing is the traditional greeting, and removing shoes before entering a home is customary. In Indian culture, eating with the right hand is traditional, and the left hand is considered unclean. In Middle Eastern cultures, showing the soles of one's feet is considered disrespectful. Understanding etiquette is important for cross-cultural communication and respect.

Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. Formal education typically occurs in schools, colleges, and universities, divided into stages such as primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Compulsory education laws require children to attend school up to a certain age. Higher education includes undergraduate and graduate studies, leading to degrees such as bachelor's, master's, and doctorate. The oldest universities include the University of Bologna (founded 1088), the University of Oxford (c. 1096), and the University of Paris (c. 1150). Education systems vary around the world, with different curricula, teaching methods, and assessment practices.

The legal system is a set of rules and institutions that regulate behavior and resolve disputes. Major legal traditions include common law (used in England, the United States, and other former British colonies), based on judicial precedents; civil law (used in continental Europe and many other countries), based on codified statutes; religious law (such as Islamic Sharia law and Jewish Halakha); and customary law, based on traditional practices. International law governs relations between states and is based on treaties, customs, and general principles of law. The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the UN.

Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behavior and are regularly protected in municipal and international law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) outlines fundamental rights to be universally protected, including the right to life, liberty, and security; freedom from torture and slavery; freedom of opinion and expression; and the right to education and work. Human rights are monitored by international organizations such as the UN Human Rights Council and non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

Transportation is the movement of people and goods from one location to another. Modes of transport include land (road, rail), water (shipping, boats), air (aviation), and space. Road transport includes cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles. Rail transport includes trains and subways. Water transport includes ships, boats, and ferries. Air transport includes airplanes and helicopters. Major transportation infrastructure includes roads, railways, ports, airports, and canals. The development of transportation has been crucial to economic development, trade, and cultural exchange.

Communication is the transmission of information. Forms of communication include verbal (spoken language), written (text), non-verbal (body language, gestures), and visual (images, signs). Mass media, including newspapers, radio, television, and the internet, disseminate information to large audiences. Telecommunication, including telegraph, telephone, radio, television, and the internet, enables communication over long distances. The development of the internet and mobile communication has revolutionized communication, enabling instant global connectivity.

Energy is the capacity to do work. Primary energy sources include fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), nuclear energy, and renewable sources (solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass). Fossil fuels have powered the industrial revolution but contribute to climate change and air pollution. Renewable energy is growing rapidly, with solar and wind power becoming increasingly cost-competitive. Energy consumption varies widely around the world, with developed countries using significantly more energy per capita than developing countries.

Environment and ecology are concerned with the relationships between living organisms and their surroundings. Ecosystems are communities of living organisms interacting with each other and with their physical environment. Biodiversity, the variety of life forms, is essential for ecosystem health and resilience. Human activities, including habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and overexploitation, are causing a loss of biodiversity at an alarming rate. Conservation efforts aim to protect ecosystems and species through protected areas, sustainable practices, and restoration.

Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. Global health issues include infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, COVID-19), non-communicable diseases (heart disease, cancer, diabetes), mental health disorders, and malnutrition. Health systems vary around the world, with some countries providing universal healthcare (such as the UK's National Health Service) and others relying on private insurance. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the past century, from about 31 years globally in 1900 to about 73 years today, though significant disparities exist between countries.

The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks. The internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, including the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. As of 2024, about 5.5 billion people (about 68% of the world's population) use the internet. The internet has transformed communication, commerce, education, and entertainment.

Social media are interactive technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, interests, and other forms of expression through virtual communities and networks. Major platforms include Facebook (founded 2004), YouTube (2005), WhatsApp (2009), Instagram (2010), TikTok (2016), and X/Twitter (2006). Social media have had a profound impact on society, enabling new forms of communication and community, but also raising concerns about privacy, misinformation, echo chambers, and mental health.

Technology continues to advance rapidly. Emerging technologies include artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, nanotechnology, virtual and augmented reality, blockchain, and the Internet of Things. These technologies have the potential to solve pressing global challenges but also raise ethical and social concerns. The pace of technological change is accelerating, with profound implications for the economy, society, and human identity.

The future is uncertain but will be shaped by trends such as demographic change, climate change, technological innovation, and geopolitical shifts. Key challenges for humanity include achieving sustainable development, reducing inequality, preventing conflict, and ensuring human well-being. International cooperation, scientific research, and ethical reflection will be essential to navigating the complex challenges and opportunities ahead.
