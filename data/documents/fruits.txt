Apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree. Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian traditions. Apple varieties include Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji, Gala, Honeycrisp, and Golden Delicious.

Banana is an elongated, edible fruit produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains, distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. Bananas are a staple food source and are cultivated in 135 countries primarily for their fruit and to a lesser extent for fiber, banana wine, and ornamental plants.

Orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae. It primarily refers to Citrus sinensis, which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The orange is a hybrid between pomelo and mandarin. The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced. Oranges originated in a region encompassing Southern China, Northeast India, and Myanmar.

Strawberry is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Strawberries are rich in vitamin C and manganese and provide a good amount of folate and potassium.

Mango is a stone fruit produced from numerous species of tropical trees belonging to the flowering plant genus Mangifera, cultivated mostly for their edible fruit. Most of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes. The genus belongs to the cashew family Anacardiaceae. Mangoes are native to South Asia, from where the common mango or Indian mango, Mangifera indica, has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics.

Grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, jam, grape juice, jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters. The cultivation of grapes began approximately 8,000 years ago, and the fruit has been used as human food throughout its history.

Watermelon is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties. Watermelon is grown in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide for its large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties exist.

Pineapple is a tropical plant with an edible fruit and the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae. The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Pineapples are consumed fresh, cooked, juiced, and preserved, and are found in a wide array of cuisines. The fruit is typically prepared by removing the crown, skin, and eyes, then cutting into slices or chunks.

Cherry is a fruit that grows on trees or shrubs of the genus Prunus. Many cherries are members of the subgenus Cerasus, which is distinguished by having the flowers in small corymbs of several together, and by having smooth fruit with only a weak groove or none along one side. Cherries have a short growing season and can grow in most temperate latitudes. Cherry trees are grown for their fruit and also for ornamental purposes, with the Japanese cherry blossom tree being a notable example.

Peach is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated. It bears an edible juicy fruit called a peach. The peach tree belongs to the family Rosaceae, and the genus Prunus, which includes cherries, apricots, almonds, and plums. Peaches are a popular fruit worldwide and are eaten fresh or used in pies, cobblers, and jams. The flesh is very delicate and easily bruised in some cultivars, but is fairly firm in some commercial varieties.

Climate change describes a change in the global or regional climate pattern. In particular, since the mid-20th century, human activity has significantly impacted the global climate, leading to what is commonly called global warming. The term is frequently used in the context of the current human-induced climate change, often referred to as anthropogenic climate change. Human-caused climate change is one of the biggest threats to global biodiversity and has already caused observable effects on the environment.

Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly measured as the average increase in Earth's global surface temperature.

Deforestation is the large-scale removal of trees from forests (or other lands) for the facilitation of human activities. It is a serious environmental concern since it can result in the loss of biodiversity, damage to natural habitats, disturbances in the water cycle, and soil erosion. Deforestation is also a contributor to global warming and climate change. Tropical rainforests are the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, and their deforestation has been the subject of intense international concern.

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When the Sun's energy reaches the Earth's atmosphere, some of it is reflected back to space and some is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases. The absorbed energy warms the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth. This process maintains the Earth's temperature at around 33 degrees Celsius warmer than it would otherwise be, allowing life on Earth to exist. The main greenhouse gases are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone.

Biodiversity is the variety and variability of life on Earth. Biodiversity is typically a measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem level. Terrestrial biodiversity is usually greater near the equator, which is the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth; it is richest in the tropics. These tropical forest ecosystems cover less than 10% of earth's surface and contain about 90% of the world's species. Marine biodiversity is usually highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest, and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans.

Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. It includes sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy stands in contrast to fossil fuels, which are being used far more quickly than they are being replenished. Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not. For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation.

Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife, and their habitat. Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized by size into micro-, meso-, or macro debris. Plastics are inexpensive and durable, making them very adaptable for different uses; as a result, manufacturers choose to use plastic over other materials. However, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade. Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment.

Ozone depletion consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s: a steady lowering of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth's atmosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth's polar regions. The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole. In addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena, there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events. The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is manufactured chemicals, especially manufactured halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, halons).

Sustainable development is an organizing principle for meeting human development goals while also sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services on which the economy and society depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resources are used to continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Endangered species are species that are very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching, and invasive species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land development, or create protected areas.

Apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Apples are generally rich in vitamin C, fiber, and various antioxidants. A typical apple is 2.5 to 3.5 inches in diameter and weighs about 150 grams. The skin of the apple can be red, green, yellow, or a combination of these colors. Popular varieties include Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji, Gala, Honeycrisp, Pink Lady, and Golden Delicious.

The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Pineapples are consumed fresh, cooked, juiced, and preserved, and are found in a wide array of cuisines. The fruit is typically prepared by removing the crown, skin, and eyes, then cutting into slices or chunks. Pineapples are the only bromeliad that produces edible fruit, and each pineapple plant produces just one fruit per cycle. They are a rich source of manganese, vitamin C, and bromelain, an enzyme that breaks down protein and can be used as a meat tenderizer. The fruit grows from the center of the plant, which has long, sword-like leaves arranged in a spiral.

Cherry is a fruit that grows on trees or shrubs of the genus Prunus. Many cherries are members of the subgenus Cerasus, which is distinguished by having the flowers in small corymbs of several together, and by having smooth fruit with only a weak groove or none along one side. Cherries have a short growing season and can grow in most temperate latitudes. Cherry trees are grown for their fruit and also for ornamental purposes, with the Japanese cherry blossom tree being a notable example. There are two main types of cherries: sweet cherries (Prunus avium) and sour cherries (Prunus cerasus). Sweet cherries are typically eaten fresh, while sour cherries are often used in cooking and baking. Cherries are rich in antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, which give them their red color, and melatonin, which may help regulate sleep cycles.

Peach is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated. It bears an edible juicy fruit called a peach. The peach tree belongs to the family Rosaceae, and the genus Prunus, which includes cherries, apricots, almonds, and plums. Peaches are a popular fruit worldwide and are eaten fresh or used in pies, cobblers, and jams. The flesh is very delicate and easily bruised in some cultivars, but is fairly firm in some commercial varieties. Peaches are divided into two categories: freestone and clingstone, referring to how easily the flesh separates from the pit. They are a good source of vitamins A and C, as well as fiber. The skin of a peach is fuzzy, while a nectarine is a smooth-skinned variety of the same species.

Pear is a fruit produced by trees of the genus Pyrus, in the family Rosaceae. Pears are native to coastal and mildly temperate regions of the Old World, from Western Europe and North Africa east across Asia. They are medium-sized trees, reaching 10-17 meters tall, often with a tall, narrow crown. Pears are consumed fresh, canned, as juice, and dried. The juice can also be used in jellies and jams, usually in combination with other fruits. Pears are a good source of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and copper. Unlike other fruits, pears ripen best off the tree. If left on the tree, they can develop a gritty texture. Popular pear varieties include Bartlett, Bosc, Anjou, and Comice.

Pomegranate is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub in the family Lythraceae, subfamily Punicoideae, that grows between 5 and 10 meters tall. The pomegranate was originally described throughout the Mediterranean region. It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769. The fruit is typically in season in the Northern Hemisphere from September to February. The pomegranate fruit consists of many individual seeds called arils, each surrounded by a juicy, red, edible pulp. The arils are separated by a white, bitter, inedible membrane. Pomegranates are rich in antioxidants, particularly punicalagins and anthocyanins, and are a good source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and folate. The fruit has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and is a symbol of fertility and abundance in many cultures.

Kiwi, also known as kiwifruit or Chinese gooseberry, is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia. The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is the Hayward, which is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg, with a fibrous, dull green-brown skin and bright green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture and a sweet but unique flavor. Kiwifruit is native to northern China and was first commercially grown in New Zealand, where it got its name from the kiwi bird. It is a rich source of vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin E, folate, and potassium. Kiwifruit also contains the enzyme actinidain, which can tenderize meat and is similar to the bromelain found in pineapple.

Papaya is a tropical fruit plant native to Mexico and northern South America. It has become naturalized in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The papaya fruit is large, melon-like, with a sweet, musky taste. The fruit can vary in shape from round to pear-shaped, and can be up to 20 inches long. The skin is green when unripe and turns yellow or orange when ripe. The flesh is orange or pinkish, with a cavity in the center filled with black, peppery-tasting seeds that are edible but somewhat bitter. Papaya is rich in vitamin C, vitamin A, folate, and dietary fiber. It also contains the enzyme papain, which helps digest proteins and is used as a meat tenderizer. Unripe green papaya is often used in savory dishes, particularly in Southeast Asian cuisine like Thai som tam salad.

Lemon is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to Asia, primarily Northeast India, Northern Myanmar, or China. The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses. The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, which gives a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie. Lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C and contain smaller amounts of B vitamins and minerals. Lemon zest, the grated outer skin, is used to add flavor to baked goods, marinades, and dressings.

Lime is a citrus fruit, which is typically round, green in color, 3-6 centimeters in diameter, and contains acidic juice vesicles. There are several species of citrus trees whose fruits are called limes, including the Key lime (Citrus aurantiifolia), Persian lime (Citrus latifolia), and desert lime (Citrus glauca). Limes are a rich source of vitamin C, are often used to accent the flavors of foods and beverages. They are grown year-round and are usually smaller and less sour than lemons. Limes have higher sugar and citric acid content than lemons. The juice can be used in cocktails such as margaritas and mojitos, and is also used in ceviche, a dish where raw fish is "cooked" by the acid in the lime juice.

Coconut is the fruit of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera), a member of the palm tree family Arecaceae. The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which is a drupe, not a nut. Coconuts are known for their versatility, providing food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine, and building materials. The inner flesh of the mature seed, as well as the coconut milk extracted from it, form a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid called coconut water or coconut juice. Mature, ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds, or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh, charcoal from the hard shell, and coir from the fibrous husk.

Blueberry is a widely distributed and widespread group of perennial flowering plants with blue or purple berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium. Commercial blueberries—both wild and cultivated —are native to North America. Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters to 4 meters in height. The fruit is a berry 5-16 millimeters in diameter with a flared crown at the end; they are pale greenish at first, then reddish-purple, and finally dark purple when ripe. They have a sweet taste when mature, with variable acidity. Blueberries are a rich source of antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, which give them their blue color, as well as vitamin C, vitamin K, and manganese. They are often consumed fresh, baked into muffins and pies, or processed into jams and juices.

Raspberry is the edible fruit of a multitude of plant species in the genus Rubus of the rose family, most of which are in the subgenus Idaeobatus. The name also applies to these plants themselves. Raspberries are perennial with woody stems. The fruit typically weighs 3-5 grams and is composed of around 100 drupelets, small juicy beads that are each an individual fruit with a seed. They are typically red, but there are also purple, black, golden, and white varieties. Raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C, manganese, and dietary fiber. They are also high in antioxidant compounds, particularly ellagic acid and anthocyanins. Raspberries are highly perishable and are often consumed fresh, frozen, or processed into jams, purees, juices, or as a flavoring in yogurts and desserts.

Blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the rose family, hybrids among these species within the subgenus Rubus, and hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus. The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis, so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates. Unlike raspberries, when blackberries are picked, the torus (receptacle) stays with the fruit, giving it a solid core. Blackberries are a rich source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and dietary fiber, as well as antioxidants such as anthocyanins and ellagic acid. They can be eaten fresh, used in pies and crumbles, or processed into jams, jellies, and wines.

Cranberry is a group of evergreen dwarf shrubs or trailing vines in the subgenus Oxycoccus of the genus Vaccinium. In Britain, cranberry may refer to the native species Vaccinium oxycoccos, while in North America, cranberry may refer to Vaccinium macrocarpon. Cranberries are a major commercial crop in certain American states and Canadian provinces. The fruit is a berry that is larger than the leaves of the plant; it is initially white, but turns deep red when fully ripe. It is edible, with an acidic taste that can overwhelm its sweetness. Cranberries are a rich source of vitamin C, dietary fiber, and manganese. They are also high in antioxidant polyphenols, particularly proanthocyanidins, which may help prevent urinary tract infections. Cranberries are commonly processed into juice, sauce, jams, and dried sweetened cranberries, and are a traditional accompaniment to turkey in Thanksgiving dinners.

Apricot is a fruit, or the tree that bears the fruit, of several species in the genus Prunus (stone fruits). Usually, an apricot is from the species P. armeniaca, but the fruits of the other species in Prunus sect. Armeniaca are also called apricots. Apricots are small, golden orange fruits with velvety skin and flesh that is not too juicy but quite sweet when ripe. They are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fiber. Apricots are native to Central Asia and have been cultivated for thousands of years. They are often eaten fresh, dried, or used in jams, preserves, and baked goods. Dried apricots are a common dried fruit, with a chewy texture and concentrated sweetness. The kernels inside apricot pits can be used to make persipan, a substance similar to almond-based marzipan.

Plum is a fruit of some species in Prunus subg. Prunus. Dried plums are known as prunes. Plums are a diverse group of species, with trees reaching 5-6 meters tall. The fruit is a drupe, with a single large seed enclosed in a hard stone. The fleshy part of the fruit is smooth and can be eaten fresh or used in jams, jellies, and desserts. Plums come in a wide variety of colors, including red, purple, blue-black, red, green, yellow, and orange. They are a good source of vitamins A, C, and K, as well as dietary fiber and antioxidants. Prunes, or dried plums, are known for their laxative effect due to their high fiber and sorbitol content. Popular plum varieties include Santa Rosa, Satsuma, and Damson.

Fig is the edible fruit of Ficus carica, a species of small tree in the flowering plant family Moraceae. Native to the Middle East and Western Asia, it has been sought out and cultivated since ancient times and is now widely grown throughout the world, both for its fruit and as an ornamental plant. Figs are a unique fruit because they are actually an inverted flower, with the flowers blooming inside the pear-shaped pod, which later matures into the fruit. The fruit is rich in natural sugars, minerals, and soluble fiber. Figs are a good source of calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and iron. They can be eaten fresh or dried, and are used in jams, baked goods, and desserts. In some cultures, fig leaves are also used for wrapping food.

Date is the fruit of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), a tree in the family Arecaceae. Dates have been a staple food of the Middle East and the Indus Valley for thousands of years. They are a traditional crop in these regions and are cultivated for their sweet, edible fruit. Dates are oval to cylindrical in shape, about 3-7 centimeters long, and 2-3 centimeters in diameter, and when ripe, range from bright red to bright yellow in color, depending on variety. Dates contain a single stone about 2-2.5 centimeters long and 6-8 millimeters thick. There are three main cultivar groups of dates: soft, semi-dry, and dry, depending on the glucose, fructose, and sucrose content. Dates are an excellent source of dietary fiber, potassium, copper, and magnesium, as well as antioxidants. They are often eaten fresh or dried, and are used in a variety of desserts and sweet dishes.

Guava is a common tropical fruit cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions. The most frequently eaten species, and the one often simply called guava, is the apple guava (Psidium guajava). Guavas are typical Myrtoideae, with tough dark leaves that are opposite, simple, elliptic to ovate, and 5-15 centimeters long. The flowers are white, with five petals and numerous stamens. The fruit is edible, round to pear-shaped, between 3 and 10 centimeters in diameter, with a thin, delicate skin.
