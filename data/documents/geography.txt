Etiquette refers to the customary code of polite behavior in society or among members of a particular profession or group. It varies across cultures. In many Western cultures, etiquette includes shaking hands when greeting, maintaining eye contact, saying "please" and "thank you," and not interrupting others. In Japanese culture, bowing is the traditional greeting, and removing shoes before entering a home is customary. In Indian culture, eating with the right hand is traditional, and the left hand is considered unclean. In Middle Eastern cultures, showing the soles of one's feet is considered disrespectful. Understanding etiquette is important for cross-cultural communication and respect.

Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. Formal education typically occurs in schools, colleges, and universities, divided into stages such as primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Compulsory education laws require children to attend school up to a certain age. Higher education includes undergraduate and graduate studies, leading to degrees such as bachelor's, master's, and doctorate. The oldest universities include the University of Bologna (founded 1088), the University of Oxford (c. 1096), and the University of Paris (c. 1150). Education systems vary around the world, with different curricula, teaching methods, and assessment practices.
