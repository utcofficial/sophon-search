Lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.

Tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognizable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent.

Elephant is the largest existing land animal. Three species are currently recognized: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. They are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are considered a keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a distinct appearance with their long trunk, large ears, and tusks.

Giraffe is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.

Zebra is a species of African equids united by their distinctive black-and-white striped coats. Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated. There are three living species: the Grévy's zebra, plains zebra, and mountain zebra. Zebras are known for their migrations and their ability to run at speeds up to 65 km/h.

Kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae. In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea. The Australian government estimates that more than 50 million kangaroos live within the commercial harvest areas of Australia. Kangaroos are known for their powerful hind legs, large feet, and long muscular tails for balance.

Panda, also known as giant panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name giant panda is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.

Dolphin is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetacea. Dolphin species belong to the families Delphinidae, Platanistidae, Iniidae, and Pontoporiidae. There are 40 extant species named as dolphins. Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m long and 50 kg Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m and 10 t killer whale. Dolphins are widespread, with the greatest diversity occurring in shallow waters of tropical oceans. They are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and acrobatic displays.

Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia. Eagles are characterized by their large size, powerful build, heavy head and beak, and excellent eyesight, which enables them to spot prey from a great distance.

Shark is a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha and are the sister group to the rays. Some species of shark are apex predators, organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2,000 m, but generally prefer coastal waters.

The Universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. According to this theory, the universe expanded from an initial state of extremely high density and temperature, and has been expanding ever since. The universe is composed of approximately 5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy. The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter. There are an estimated 100 to 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe, each containing hundreds of billions of stars. The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, with the Sun as its central star. The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.

The Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's interior is divided into layers: the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. The crust is the outermost layer, ranging from 5 to 70 kilometers in depth. The mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core, extending to a depth of 2,890 kilometers. The outer core is a fluid layer composed of iron and nickel, about 2,300 kilometers thick, responsible for Earth's magnetic field. The inner core is a solid sphere of iron and nickel with a radius of about 1,220 kilometers, with temperatures similar to the Sun's surface.

Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. It occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift act on genetic variation, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more or less common within a population. The theory of evolution by natural selection was conceived independently by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century. Darwin's book On the Origin of Species (1859) provided the first detailed exposition of the theory. Evolution explains the diversity of life at every level of biological organization, including the development of new species and the adaptation of organisms to their environments.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. The polymer carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. The structure of DNA was discovered in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick, with crucial contributions from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. Each nucleotide in DNA contains one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). The sequence of these bases determines the genetic code, which is read in groups of three called codons. The human genome consists of about 3 billion base pairs and contains approximately 20,000-25,000 genes.

The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number. The standard form of the table consists of a grid of elements with rows called periods and columns called groups. The periodic table was first devised by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, who used it to predict undiscovered elements. There are currently 118 confirmed elements, with the most recent additions being nihonium (Nh), moscovium (Mc), tennessine (Ts), and oganesson (Og) in 2016. The table is divided into blocks: s-block (groups 1-2), p-block (groups 13-18), d-block (transition metals, groups 3-12), and f-block (lanthanides and actinides).

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics, including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, and quantum technology. Classical physics cannot describe phenomena at small scales. Quantum mechanics introduces concepts such as wave-particle duality, where particles exhibit both wave and particle properties; quantization, where certain properties occur in discrete amounts; uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously known with precision; and quantum entanglement, where particles become correlated in ways that cannot be explained classically.

The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, comprises two interrelated theories: special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915). Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity, introducing the concept that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames and that space and time are intertwined into spacetime. It is expressed in the famous equation E=mc², which states that energy and mass are equivalent. General relativity explains gravity as a geometric property of spacetime, where massive objects cause curvature, and this curvature dictates the motion of other objects. General relativity has been confirmed by observations such as the bending of light by gravity and the expansion of the universe.

Human history begins with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa around 300,000 years ago. The prehistoric period includes the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). The Neolithic Revolution, beginning around 10,000 BCE, marked the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural communities. This led to the rise of the first civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China. The Bronze Age saw the development of writing, cities, and organized states. The Iron Age followed, with the rise of empires such as the Assyrian, Persian, Greek, and Roman. The classical era saw the flourishing of philosophy, art, and science in Greece and Rome, the development of major religions including Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism, and the establishment of trade routes like the Silk Road connecting East and West.

The Middle Ages in Europe spanned from the 5th to the 15th century, beginning with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and ending with the Renaissance and Age of Discovery. This period saw the rise of feudalism, the spread of Christianity, the Crusades, and the development of Gothic architecture. The Islamic Golden Age (8th-14th centuries) saw advances in science, mathematics, medicine, and philosophy in the Islamic world. In Asia, the Tang and Song dynasties in China saw technological innovations including printing, gunpowder, and the compass. The Mongol Empire became the largest contiguous land empire in history, facilitating trade and communication across Eurasia.

The Renaissance was a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity, covering the 15th and 16th centuries. It began in Italy and spread throughout Europe, characterized by a revival of interest in classical learning and values. Key figures included Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Galileo. The Renaissance saw advances in art, science, and exploration. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1450 revolutionized the spread of knowledge. The Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther in 1517, challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and led to the establishment of Protestantism.

The Age of Discovery (15th-17th centuries) saw European exploration and colonization of the world. Portuguese and Spanish explorers led the way, with Christopher Columbus reaching the Americas in 1492, Vasco da Gama reaching India in 1498, and Ferdinand Magellan's expedition circumnavigating the globe in 1522. This led to the Columbian Exchange, the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World. The period also saw the rise of colonial empires, the transatlantic slave trade, and the beginning of globalization.

The Scientific Revolution (16th-18th centuries) transformed views of nature and society. Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the universe, challenging the geocentric view. Johannes Kepler formulated laws of planetary motion. Galileo Galilei made pioneering astronomical observations with the telescope. Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion and universal gravitation, laying the foundations for classical mechanics. The scientific method, emphasizing empirical observation and experimentation, was developed by Francis Bacon and René Descartes. This period also saw advances in medicine, with William Harvey describing the circulation of blood.

The Enlightenment was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism of traditional authority. Key thinkers included John Locke, who developed ideas of natural rights and government by consent; Voltaire, who advocated for freedom of speech and religion; Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who explored the social contract; and Immanuel Kant, who defined enlightenment as "man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity." Enlightenment ideas influenced the American Revolution (1775-1783) and the French Revolution (1789-1799), leading to the spread of democratic ideals.

The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, occurring from around 1760 to about 1820-1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools, and the rise of the factory system. Key inventions included the steam engine (James Watt), the spinning jenny (James Hargreaves), the power loom (Edmund Cartwright), and the cotton gin (Eli Whitney). The Industrial Revolution led to unprecedented economic growth, urbanization, and social change, but also to poor working conditions, child labor, and environmental pollution.

The 19th century saw the rise of nationalism, imperialism, and socialism. The Napoleonic Wars reshaped Europe. The Congress of Vienna (1815) established a balance of power. Latin American wars of independence ended Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule. The American Civil War (1861-1865) ended slavery in the United States. The unification of Italy and Germany created new nation-states. The British Empire became the largest empire in history, spanning a quarter of the world's land area. The Scramble for Africa saw European powers colonize almost the entire continent. The Meiji Restoration in Japan transformed it into a modern industrial power. Scientific advances included Darwin's theory of evolution, the germ theory of disease (Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch), and the development of the periodic table. Technological advances included the telegraph, the telephone (Alexander Graham Bell), the light bulb (Thomas Edison), and the internal combustion engine.

The 20th century was marked by two world wars, the Cold War, and rapid technological change. World War I (1914-1918) was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and resulted in over 20 million casualties. The war led to the collapse of four empires (German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian) and the redrawing of national boundaries. The Russian Revolution (1917) established the world's first communist state. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was a severe worldwide economic downturn. World War II (1939-1945) was the deadliest conflict in human history, with an estimated 70-85 million fatalities. It involved the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) and the Allies (United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, China). The war ended with the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ushering in the nuclear age.

The post-war period saw the Cold War (1947-1991) between the United States and the Soviet Union, a ideological and geopolitical struggle that divided the world into capitalist and communist blocs. The Cold War was characterized by the nuclear arms race, proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, the space race, and the formation of military alliances (NATO and Warsaw Pact). Decolonization saw the independence of former colonies in Asia and Africa. The United Nations was established in 1945 to promote international cooperation. The European Union evolved from the European Coal and Steel Community (1951) to a political and economic union of 27 member states.

The digital revolution, also known as the Information Age, began in the late 20th century with the development of the microprocessor, the personal computer, and the internet. The first general-purpose electronic computer, ENIAC, was completed in 1945. The transistor, invented in 1947, replaced vacuum tubes and enabled smaller, more efficient electronics. The integrated circuit (1958) allowed multiple transistors on a single chip. The microprocessor (1971) put a computer's central processing unit on a single chip. The personal computer became widely available in the 1980s with the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh. The internet originated from ARPANET, a US Department of Defense project in the 1960s. The World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, made the internet accessible to the public. The 21st century has seen the rise of smartphones, social media, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans. AI research has been divided into subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Machine learning algorithms build models based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. AI applications include virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and game playing (AlphaGo). The development of large language models like GPT has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling machines to generate human-like text, answer questions, and assist with creative tasks.

Space exploration began in the mid-20th century with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, the first artificial satellite. The Space Race between the US and USSR led to a series of achievements: the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin, 1961), the first human on the Moon (Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11, 1969), and the first space stations. Robotic exploration has included missions to all planets of the Solar System: Mariner and Viking to Mars, Voyager to the outer planets, Galileo to Jupiter, Cassini to Saturn, and New Horizons to Pluto. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, has provided stunning images and invaluable scientific data. The International Space Station has been continuously occupied since 2000. Recent developments include commercial spaceflight (SpaceX, Blue Origin), plans for lunar bases (Artemis program), and missions to Mars (Perseverance rover).

Medicine has advanced dramatically in the modern era. The germ theory of disease, developed in the 19th century, led to the development of vaccines and antibiotics. The first vaccine was developed by Edward Jenner for smallpox in 1796. Penicillin, the first antibiotic, was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and mass-produced during World War II. The structure of DNA was discovered in 1953, leading to the development of genetic engineering and biotechnology. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, mapped the entire human genome. Medical imaging has advanced from X-rays (1895) to CT scans, MRI, and PET scans. Organ transplantation became possible with the first kidney transplant in 1954 and the first heart transplant in 1967. Recent advances include gene therapy, immunotherapy for cancer, mRNA vaccines (used for COVID-19), and personalized medicine based on genetic profiles.

Climate change is a pressing global issue. The Earth's climate has changed throughout history, but since the Industrial Revolution, human activities have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, methane from agriculture, and nitrous oxide from industry. This has led to global warming, with the Earth's average temperature rising by about 1.2°C since the late 19th century. Effects include more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms; rising sea levels due to melting ice sheets and glaciers; ocean acidification; and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. International efforts to address climate change include the Paris Agreement (2015), in which countries pledged to limit global warming to well below 2°C. Solutions involve transitioning to renewable energy (solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal), improving energy efficiency, electrifying transportation, protecting forests, and developing carbon capture technologies.

Economics is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Microeconomics focuses on individual agents and markets, analyzing supply and demand, pricing, and competition. Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole, studying phenomena such as inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy. Major economic systems include capitalism, based on private ownership and market mechanisms; socialism, based on social ownership and cooperative management; and communism, which aims for common ownership and the absence of social classes. The Industrial Revolution led to the development of classical economics (Adam Smith, David Ricardo). The Great Depression influenced Keynesian economics (John Maynard Keynes), which advocates government intervention to stabilize the economy. The late 20th century saw the rise of neoliberalism, emphasizing free markets and deregulation. The 2008 financial crisis led to renewed interest in regulation and alternative economic models.

Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Major branches include metaphysics (the nature of reality), epistemology (the theory of knowledge), ethics (moral philosophy), logic (principles of valid reasoning), and aesthetics (the nature of beauty). Western philosophy began in ancient Greece with thinkers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Plato developed the theory of Forms, arguing that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality. Aristotle contributed to logic, metaphysics, ethics, and natural sciences. Hellenistic philosophy included Epicureanism (seeking pleasure through moderation) and Stoicism (living in accordance with nature and virtue). Medieval philosophy integrated classical thought with religious doctrine, particularly in the works of Augustine and Aquinas. Modern philosophy began with Descartes ("I think, therefore I am"), who emphasized rationalism, and empiricists such as Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, who stressed experience. Kant synthesized rationalism and empiricism, proposing that the mind shapes our experience of reality. 19th-century philosophy included Hegel's idealism, Marx's materialism, Kierkegaard's existentialism, and Nietzsche's critique of morality. 20th-century philosophy included analytic philosophy (Russell, Wittgenstein), phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger), existentialism (Sartre, Camus), and postmodernism (Foucault, Derrida).

Eastern philosophy encompasses diverse traditions from Asia. Indian philosophy includes Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Hindu philosophy includes six orthodox schools: Nyaya (logic), Vaisheshika (atomism), Samkhya (enumeration), Yoga (meditation), Mimamsa (ritual), and Vedanta (end of the Vedas). Key concepts include dharma (duty/ethics), karma (action and consequence), samsara (cycle of rebirth), and moksha (liberation). Buddhist philosophy, founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the 5th century BCE, emphasizes the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path to the end of suffering. The Eightfold Path provides practical guidance for ethical and mental development. Chinese philosophy includes Confucianism, Taoism, and Legalism. Confucianism, founded by Confucius, emphasizes social harmony, filial piety, and moral cultivation through rituals and relationships. Taoism, attributed to Laozi, emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (the Way), spontaneity, and non-action (wu wei). Zen Buddhism, a synthesis of Indian Buddhism and Chinese Taoism, emphasizes meditation and direct insight into one's true nature.

Religion is a cultural system of beliefs and practices concerning the sacred, often involving a deity or deities, rituals, and moral codes. Major world religions include Christianity (2.4 billion adherents), based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, emphasizing salvation through faith in Christ. Islam (1.9 billion adherents), founded by Muhammad in the 7th century CE, emphasizes submission to the will of Allah (God) as revealed in the Quran. Hinduism (1.2 billion adherents) is a diverse set of traditions originating in India, with beliefs including dharma, karma, and reincarnation. Buddhism (520 million adherents) focuses on spiritual development and the attainment of nirvana. Judaism (15 million adherents) is the monotheistic religion of the Jewish people, based on the Torah and Talmud. Other religions include Sikhism, Shinto, Taoism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and indigenous traditions. Religion has played a central role in human history, influencing art, culture, politics, and conflict.

Literature is the art of written work, encompassing poetry, prose, and drama. Poetry uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language, including meter and rhyme, to evoke meanings and emotions. Epic poetry includes Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, and the Indian Mahabharata and Ramayana. Drama includes the tragedies and comedies of ancient Greece (Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes), the plays of Shakespeare, and modern drama (Ibsen, Chekhov, Miller). Prose fiction includes the novel, which emerged in the 18th century with works such as Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Richardson's Pamela. Major novelists include Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, George Eliot, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, Gabriel García Márquez, and Toni Morrison. Literary movements include Romanticism, Realism, Naturalism, Modernism, and Postmodernism.

Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. Visual arts include painting, sculpture, drawing, printmaking, and photography. Major periods in Western art include Classical (Greek and Roman), Medieval (Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic), Renaissance (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael), Baroque (Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt), Rococo (Watteau, Fragonard), Neoclassicism (David, Canova), Romanticism (Delacroix, Turner), Realism (Courbet), Impressionism (Monet, Renoir), Post-Impressionism (van Gogh, Cézanne), Cubism (Picasso, Braque), Surrealism (Dalí, Magritte), Abstract Expressionism (Pollock, Rothko), Pop Art (Warhol, Lichtenstein), and Contemporary art. Non-Western art traditions include African, Islamic, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese art, each with distinct styles, techniques, and philosophies.

Music is an art form whose medium is sound and silence. Common elements include pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and timbre. Music can be divided into genres such as classical, jazz, folk, rock, pop, and electronic. Classical music traditions include Western classical (from medieval to contemporary), Indian classical (Carnatic and Hindustani), and Chinese classical. Western classical music periods include Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque (Bach, Handel, Vivaldi), Classical (Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven), Romantic (Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Liszt, Wagner, Brahms, Tchaikovsky), Modern (Debussy, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Bartók), and Contemporary. Jazz originated in African American communities in New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, developing styles including swing, bebop, cool jazz, and fusion (Armstrong, Ellington, Parker, Davis, Coltrane). Rock music emerged in the 1950s, with genres including rock and roll (Presley), rock (The Beatles, The Rolling Stones), hard rock (Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple), punk (The Ramones, The Sex Pistols), alternative (Nirvana, Radiohead), and metal (Black Sabbath, Metallica). Pop music emphasizes catchy melodies and hooks, with artists such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift.

Film, also called movies or cinema, is a form of visual art using moving images to tell stories or convey ideas. The history of film began in the late 19th century with the invention of motion picture cameras. Early films were short, silent, and black and white. The introduction of sound in the late 1920s ("talkies") revolutionized the medium. Major film movements include German Expressionism (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari), Soviet Montage (Battleship Potemkin), French Poetic Realism, Italian Neorealism (Bicycle Thieves), French New Wave (Breathless), and New Hollywood (The Godfather). Major directors include Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Akira Kurosawa, Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Quentin Tarantino. Film genres include comedy, drama, horror, science fiction, western, musical, documentary, and animation.

Architecture is both the process and product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural styles have evolved throughout history, reflecting cultural, technological, and aesthetic trends. Ancient architecture includes Egyptian pyramids, Greek temples (Parthenon), and Roman structures (Colosseum, aqueducts). Medieval architecture includes Byzantine (Hagia Sophia), Romanesque (Durham Cathedral), and Gothic (Notre-Dame, Chartres) styles. Renaissance architecture revived classical forms (Brunelleschi's Duomo, St. Peter's Basilica). Baroque architecture emphasized drama and grandeur (Versailles, St. Paul's Cathedral). Modern architecture emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, emphasizing function, simplicity, and new materials (steel, glass, concrete). Key figures include Frank Lloyd Wright (Fallingwater), Le Corbusier (Villa Savoye), Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (Seagram Building), and Walter Gropius (Bauhaus). Postmodern architecture, from the late 20th century, incorporated historical elements and playful forms (Philip Johnson's AT&T Building). Contemporary architecture includes sustainable design, parametricism, and iconic structures like the Burj Khalifa and the Sydney Opera House.
