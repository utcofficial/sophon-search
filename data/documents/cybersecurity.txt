Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Its importance is growing due to increasing reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards. The field has become significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things (IoT).

Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them. Ethical hackers are also known as white hat hackers, and they use the same methods and techniques as their malicious counterparts, but with the permission of the system owner.

Penetration testing, also called pen testing, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF). Pen testing involves attempting to break into any number of application systems to detect vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized inputs that are susceptible to code injection attacks. Insights provided by the penetration test can be used to fine-tune your WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities.

Malware, short for malicious software, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. A wide variety of malware types exist, including computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, rogue software, wiper, and scareware. Malware poses serious problems for individuals and businesses alike, with the potential to cause data loss, system failure, and operational disruption.

Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way that is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, which encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan disguised as a legitimate file that the user is tricked into downloading or opening.

Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a human victim into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim is navigating the site, and transverse any additional security boundaries with the victim.

DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service) is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam clogging up the highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.

SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution. SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007. XSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site.

Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other. One example of a MITM attack is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.

Firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. Firewalls have been a first line of defense in network security for over 25 years. They establish a barrier between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet. A firewall can be hardware, software, or both.

Encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm.

VPN (Virtual Private Network) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. Encryption is common, although not an inherent part of a VPN connection. VPNs provide increased security and privacy, especially when using public Wi-Fi hotspots.

Zero-day vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is unknown to, or unaddressed by, those who should be interested in its mitigation. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network. An exploit directed at a zero-day vulnerability is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack. The term "zero-day" originally referred to the number of days since a new piece of software was released to the public.

Bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites, organizations, and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities. These programs allow the developers to discover and resolve bugs before the general public is aware of them, preventing incidents of widespread abuse. Bug bounty programs have been implemented by a large number of organizations, including Mozilla, Facebook, Yahoo!, Google, Reddit, Square, Microsoft, and the United States Department of Defense.

Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This differs from social engineering within the social sciences, which does not concern the divulging of confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional "con" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme. The term "social engineering" as an act of psychological manipulation is also associated with the social sciences, but its usage has caught on among computer and information security professionals.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism. 2FA adds an additional layer of security to the authentication process, making it harder for attackers to gain access to a person's devices or online accounts because, even if the victim's password is hacked, a password alone is not enough to pass the authentication check.

Biometric authentication refers to a security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual to verify that they are who they say they are. Biometric authentication systems compare physical or behavioral traits to stored, confirmed, authentic data in a database. Common types of biometric authentication include fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, iris scanning, voice recognition, and hand geometry. Biometrics are considered more secure than passwords because they are much harder to replicate.

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics, and others. Core concepts related to information security are also central to cryptography: data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.

Blockchain security is a comprehensive risk management system for a blockchain network, using cybersecurity frameworks, assurance services, and best practices to reduce risks against attacks and fraud. Blockchain technology produces a structure of data with inherent security qualities. It's based on principles of cryptography, decentralization, and consensus, which ensure trust in transactions. In most blockchains or distributed ledger technologies (DLT), the data is structured into blocks and each block contains a transaction or bundle of transactions. Each new block connects to all the blocks before it in a cryptographic chain in such a way that it's nearly impossible to tamper with.

Cloud security refers to a broad set of policies, technologies, applications, and controls utilized to protect virtualized IP, data, applications, services, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing. It is a sub-domain of computer security, network security, and, more broadly, information security. Cloud security involves the procedures and technology that secure cloud computing environments against both external and insider cybersecurity threats. As more organizations migrate their data and applications to the cloud, securing these resources has become a top priority.

IoT security is the technology segment focused on safeguarding connected devices and networks in the Internet of things (IoT). IoT involves adding internet connectivity to a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, and people. Each "thing" is provided a unique identifier and the ability to automatically transfer data over a network. Allowing devices to connect to the internet opens them up to a number of serious vulnerabilities if they are not properly protected.

Network security consists of the policies, processes, and practices adopted to prevent, detect, and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them access to information and programs within their authority.

Endpoint security refers to the practice of securing endpoints or entry points of end-user devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices from being exploited by malicious actors and campaigns. Endpoint security systems protect these endpoints on a network or in the cloud from cybersecurity threats. With the increase in remote work and bring your own device (BYOD) policies, endpoint security has become critical to overall network security.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the right users have the appropriate access to technology resources. IAM systems fall under the overarching umbrella of IT security. IAM products and services offer the ability to administer user identities, manage access permissions, and automate the process of granting and revoking access rights. IAM is considered a critical function for any enterprise, as it helps ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and systems.

Incident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack, also known as an IT incident, computer incident, or security incident. The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs. An incident response plan includes a set of instructions to help IT staff detect, respond to, and recover from network security incidents. These plans help organizations minimize the duration and impact of security incidents.

Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches relating to the type of digital devices involved: computer forensics, network forensics, forensic data analysis, and mobile device forensics. Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications, including criminal law, private investigation, and cybersecurity incident response.

The CIA triad is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The elements of the triad are considered the three most crucial components of security. Confidentiality means that data, objects, and resources are protected from unauthorized viewing and other access. Integrity means that data is protected from unauthorized changes to ensure that it is reliable and correct. Availability means that authorized users have access to the systems and the resources they need.

Data breach is a security incident in which information is accessed without authorization. Data breaches can hurt businesses and consumers in a variety of ways. They are a costly expense that can damage lives and reputations. A data breach occurs when a cybercriminal successfully infiltrates a data source and extracts sensitive information. This can be done physically by accessing a computer or network to steal local files or by bypassing network security remotely. The effects of a data breach can include financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.

Honeypot is a security mechanism that creates a virtual trap to lure attackers. An intentionally compromised computer system allows attackers to exploit vulnerabilities so that you can study them to improve your security policies. Honeypots are designed to mimic systems that would be attractive to attackers, such as vulnerable servers or network devices, and can be used to detect, deflect, or study attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems.

Security information and event management (SIEM) is a field within computer security that combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) into a single security management system. SIEM technology collects, analyzes, and correlates log data from various sources across an organization's network to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. SIEM systems help organizations detect and respond to security threats more effectively.

Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level. A SOC within a building or facility is a central location from where staff supervise the site via status displays that provide information. SOC personnel monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. The team is responsible for ensuring that potential security incidents are correctly identified, analyzed, defended, investigated, and reported. The SOC operates 24/7 to provide continuous monitoring and protection.

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is knowledge, skills, and experience-based information that can be used to understand the mechanisms of cyber threats, targets, and attacks. CTI is evidence-based knowledge that includes context, mechanisms, indicators, implications, and actionable advice about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets. This intelligence can be used to inform decisions regarding the subject's response to that menace or hazard. Threat intelligence provides organizations with the insights needed to proactively defend against cyber attacks.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines for mitigating organizational cybersecurity risks, published by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices. The framework provides a common language for understanding, managing, and expressing cybersecurity risk both internally and externally. It can be used to help identify and prioritize actions for reducing cybersecurity risk, and it is a tool for aligning policy, business, and technological approaches to managing that risk.

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines, up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover.

Cyber kill chain is a model for the stages of a cyberattack, developed by Lockheed Martin. The model describes the phases of a targeted attack, and it can be used to help organizations understand and defend against sophisticated cyber threats. The kill chain phases are: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. Understanding these stages helps security teams identify and stop attacks at each phase.

Red team vs Blue team exercises are simulations in which one group acts as attackers (red team) and another group acts as defenders (blue team). Red teams attempt to breach the organization's security defenses, while blue teams defend against the attack and respond to incidents. These exercises provide a realistic assessment of security capabilities and help identify weaknesses that need to be addressed. Some organizations also include a purple team to maximize the effectiveness of the exercise.

Threat hunting is the practice of proactively searching for cyber threats that are lurking undetected in a network. Unlike traditional security measures that react to alerts and known threats, threat hunting assumes that a breach has already occurred and actively looks for signs of malicious activity. This approach helps organizations discover sophisticated attacks that may have evaded existing security controls. Threat hunting involves using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate a compromise.

Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. The result is that an application with more privileges than intended by the application developer or system administrator can perform unauthorized actions. Privilege escalation can be vertical (gaining higher privileges) or horizontal (gaining the same privileges as another user).

Brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN). In a brute force attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data. Brute force attacks may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by security analysts to test an organization's network security. These attacks can be time-consuming but are often successful due to weak passwords.

Keylogger is a type of surveillance software or hardware designed to record keystrokes made on a computer keyboard. Keyloggers are used in IT organizations to troubleshoot technical problems with computers and business networks. However, malicious individuals may use keyloggers on public computers to steal passwords or credit card information. Keyloggers can be software-based (installed on the operating system) or hardware-based (a physical device attached to the computer).

Rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or areas of its software that would not otherwise be allowed and often masks its existence or the existence of other software. The term rootkit is a combination of the words "root" (the traditional name for the privileged account on Unix-like operating systems) and "kit" (the software components that implement the tool). Rootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it after having obtained root access.

Spyware is software that aims to gather information about a person or organization without their knowledge, that may send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent, or that asserts control over a device without the consumer's knowledge. Spyware is classified as a type of malware. It can be used to monitor activities, collect personal information, and track internet usage. Spyware often installs itself without the user's knowledge and can be difficult to detect and remove.

Worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. Unlike a computer virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.

Trojan horse, or Trojan, is any malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy. Trojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear innocuous. Unlike computer viruses and worms, Trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.

Adware is software that automatically displays or downloads advertising material when a user is online. It is often used to generate revenue for the software developer. While not always malicious, adware can be intrusive and can compromise user privacy. Some adware may track browsing habits and collect personal information without consent. Adware is often bundled with free software and can be difficult to remove.

Cryptojacking is a type of cybercrime where a criminal secretly uses a victim's computing power to generate cryptocurrency. This is typically done by tricking the victim into clicking a malicious link that loads crypto mining code on their computer, or by infecting a website with JavaScript code that executes in the browser of visitors. Cryptojacking can slow down devices, increase electricity costs, and shorten the lifespan of the hardware.

Session hijacking, also known as cookie hijacking, is the exploitation of a valid computer session to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system. In session hijacking, an attacker takes over a user's session by stealing or predicting the session token. This allows the attacker to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf. Session hijacking is a serious threat, especially for web applications that rely on session-based authentication.

DNS spoofing, also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address. This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer or any other computer. DNS spoofing can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including phishing, malware distribution, and denial of service.

ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker's MAC address is connected to an authentic IP address, the attacker can begin receiving any data destined for that IP address. ARP spoofing can enable man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service, and session hijacking.

Watering hole attack is a computer attack strategy in which an attacker guesses or observes which websites a group of users often visits and infects one or more of them with malware. Eventually, some member of the targeted group will become infected. This type of attack is particularly dangerous because it targets trusted websites and can be difficult to detect. Watering hole attacks are often used in targeted attacks against specific organizations or industries.

Spear phishing is an email or electronic communications scam targeted towards a specific individual, organization, or business. Although often intended to steal data for malicious purposes, cybercriminals may also intend to install malware on a targeted user's computer. Spear phishing is more sophisticated than regular phishing because it uses personal information to make the message appear legitimate. Attackers research their targets to craft convincing messages that appear to come from trusted sources.

Whaling is a specific form of phishing that targets high-profile individuals such as executives, celebrities, or politicians. Also known as CEO fraud, whaling attacks are more sophisticated than standard phishing attacks and often involve extensive research on the target. The attacker typically sends a carefully crafted email that appears to be from a trusted source, such as a business partner or legal entity, to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information or transferring funds.

Vishing, or voice phishing, is the use of telephony to conduct phishing attacks. Vishing typically involves a caller pretending to be from a legitimate organization, such as a bank or government agency, and attempting to trick the victim into revealing personal information. Vishing attacks often use social engineering techniques to create a sense of urgency or fear, prompting the victim to act quickly without thinking.

Smishing is a form of phishing that uses SMS text messages to deliver the attack. Smishing messages typically contain a link or phone number that the victim is urged to click or call. These messages often appear to come from legitimate sources, such as banks or delivery services, and may create a sense of urgency to trick the victim into responding. Smishing attacks can lead to malware installation, credential theft, or financial loss.

Typosquatting, also called URL hijacking, is a form of cybersquatting that relies on mistakes such as typographical errors made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser. The typosquatter registers a deliberately misspelled domain name of a well-known website, hoping that users will accidentally type the incorrect address and be directed to their site. These sites may be used for malicious purposes, such as distributing malware or phishing for personal information.

Clickjacking is a malicious technique of tricking a web user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, thus potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous web pages. Clickjacking works by embedding malicious code into a legitimate website, often using invisible frames or layers. When the user clicks on what appears to be a harmless button, they are actually clicking on a hidden element that performs an unintended action.

Drive-by download is the unintentional download of malicious code onto a computer or mobile device that exposes users to different types of threats. A drive-by download can take advantage of an app, operating system, or web browser that contains security flaws due to unsuccessful or incomplete updates. In some cases, a drive-by download is used as an attack vector to install malware, spyware, or ransomware on a victim's device without their knowledge or consent.

Logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting files when they are terminated from the company. Logic bombs can be triggered by various events, such as a specific date, time, or user action. They are difficult to detect because they remain dormant until triggered.

Time bomb is a type of logic bomb that is triggered by reaching a specific date or time. Time bombs are often used by malicious insiders or attackers who want to cause damage at a predetermined time. For example, a disgruntled employee might set a time bomb to delete critical files after they have left the company. Time bombs can also be used in ransomware attacks, where files are encrypted and a ransom is demanded for the decryption key.

Backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device, or its embodiment. Backdoors are often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems. While some backdoors are installed for legitimate purposes, such as providing technical support, they are often used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems. Backdoors can be difficult to detect because they are designed to bypass normal security controls.

Exploit kit is a toolkit that cybercriminals use to attack vulnerabilities in systems so they can distribute malware or perform other malicious activities. Exploit kits are packaged with pre-written exploit code that can be used against known vulnerabilities. When a user visits a compromised website, the exploit kit scans the user's system for vulnerabilities and delivers the appropriate exploit. Exploit kits are a popular tool among cybercriminals because they require minimal technical expertise to use.
